Micro Frontends in React with Vite and Module Federation


Module Federation uses a "host" and "remote" architecture.
A host application is the main app that consumes shared code / components. A remote application is the one that exposes code to be consumed.

host – this will act as your host application

remote – this will expose the components you want to share
